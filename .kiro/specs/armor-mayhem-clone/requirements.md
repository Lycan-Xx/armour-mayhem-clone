# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Armor Mayhem Clone is a fully functional 2D platformer shooter game built with React, TypeScript, and HTML5 Canvas. The game features multiple levels, enemy AI, various weapons, particle effects, sound effects, and player progression with persistence. Players control a character that can move, jump, aim, and shoot enemies while progressing through levels.
